# Why write technical documentation?

Writing documentation is _hard_.

We try to find excuses and rationalize and lie to ourselves so we can feel better about the fact that we _should_ be doing it, but it's _"too much work"_.

Here are two good reasons to try and convince you to start writing documentation, and help _you_ while you help others, too:

### 1. You won't remember that 6 months from now

Just fixed a bug? Written a new feature? Cool! You may think you know your code _now_, but if you come back to it 6 months later, you will have forgotten most about. It will be as if someone else had written it.

**Write it down now that it's fresh on your mind**. You will be happy you did it when you come back later looking for help finding out how "this" was done and how does "that" work.

Which bring us to...

### 2. Grep is sub-optimal

Why browse the sources and reverse-engineer code when you can read a paragraph that's written for humans? It's not efficient to read 600 lines of code and run them in your head when you could simply google it.

**Remember, code is for computers and documentation is for humans**. If you are reading this, you're probably human. Optimize _your_ time.
