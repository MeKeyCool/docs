## What to contribute

We are happy that you want to contribute to the project! Here are some examples of how you can help.

#### Write

If you know your way around the guts of PrestaShop and you are comfortable writing in English:

- Pick up a subject that is either insufficiently or not at all covered by the documentation already, and write about it.
- If the subject is already covered, you can improve it by adding screenshots or examples.
- You can also write short tutorials.

#### Plan

Found a subject that is not covered or needs to be developed? Let us know by [submitting an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/PrestaShop/docs/issues/new). That way we will know where to focus on.

#### Review & proofread

You can help us by reviewing new contributions. Even if you aren't that technical, if your English is good, you can help by proofreading.
 
If you find an error, you can let us know by [submitting an issue](https://github.com/PrestaShop/docs/issues/new), or even fix it by yourself (read below for how).
 
See all the [current open Pull Requests](https://github.com/PrestaShop/docs/pulls).

## How to edit a page
 
To contribute, you'll need a GitHub account. If you don't have one, don't worry! It's free and it only takes a couple of minutes. [Create your GitHub account](https://github.com/join).

There are two ways to contribute to this documentation, each having its advantages:

1. [Edit any page on Github][1] – Best if you don't know git or you just want to quickly correct something.
2. [Edit on your computer][2] – Best if you know git and/or you want to see how your changes look.

{{% notice tip %}}
**Editing on your computer is recommended** if you already know your way around git and the [GitHub workflow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/), or if you want to work on the site itself. It will also allow you to build the site locally and check out exactly how your changes will look.

Regardless of the path you choose to contribute, you'll end up creating a Pull Request – **don't forget to submit it!**.

Once your PR is submitted, the team will promptly review it and do its best to see that your contribution is added to the documentation!
